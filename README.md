# OverIT: An Interactive Overlay forTouchscreen-based UI Customizationby Demonstration

## Abstract
Smartphones have been widely used for various purposes and stay connected at all times. However, the use of such touchscreen devices can be physically restricted depending on users' context where only one hand is available to interact with the device. We propose OverIT, a system that enables users to customize interfaces by adding new buttons on an interactive overlay which can be positioned anywhere on the touchscreen where each button serves the same functionality as an existing one. It is designed to support users to freely and easily map a certain button event to a newly created button by performing a demonstration of a button tap. We expect our system to improve the overall user experience of one-handed interaction with touchscreen devices.
