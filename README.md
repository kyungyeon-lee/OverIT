# OverIt
## Abstract

In the mobile environment, the same UI may not be suitable for various users however, many mobile apps still stick to a fixed UI.
Not only people with physical disabilities but also those who feel the inconvenience of daily use, such as having a small hand or using a smartphone with one hand, need mobile UI personalization. 
In this demo, we present a system named \textit{OverIt}, which is used to create a personalized mobile environment for people who do not have any background knowledge in computer science. 
The \textit{OverIt} is a programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to duplicate the function of the application without programming.
